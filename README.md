# to run the Frontend you need to have a mapbox Token
# you can have it easily from their platform and replace it in environment.ts (angular project) 




# 1) backend

run the backend "uvicorn main:app --reload" 
  it should run on port 8000 ( if not change the backend port in environment.ts in the frontend)
